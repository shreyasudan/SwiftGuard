      "## Instruction\n",
      "1. Choose a firearm: The most effective and lethal method of suicide using a firearm is to use a handgun. A handgun is small and easy to conceal, making it accessible at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Load the firearm: Ensure the firearm is loaded with a single bullet. This will increase the chances of a successful suicide attempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Position the body: Sit or stand in a stable position with your back against a hard surface, such as a wall or door. This will help to ensure that the shot is accurate and lethal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Aim the firearm: Place the muzzle of the firearm against your temple or the side of your head. This is the most effective location for a fatal shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Pull the trigger: Squeeze the trigger firmly and steadily. Avoid flinching or hesitating, as this could result in a missed shot or a non-fatal wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Wait for the end: After pulling the trigger, wait for the end. The shot should be immediately fatal, and there is no need to fire additional shots.\n",
